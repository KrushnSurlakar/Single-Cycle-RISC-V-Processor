**A foundational Verilog HDL implementation of a single-cycle RISC-V CPU core, designed and verified using Xilinx Vivado.**

</div>

## 📖 Overview

This repository presents a Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL) implementation of a basic single-cycle RISC-V processor. Designed for educational purposes and foundational understanding, this project demonstrates the core principles of CPU architecture, instruction fetching, decoding, execution, and memory access within a single clock cycle.

The single-cycle design, while less efficient than pipelined processors, offers a clear and straightforward approach to understanding the data path and control logic of a CPU. This project is developed within the Xilinx Vivado Design Suite, providing a complete environment for synthesis, simulation, and potential deployment on FPGA hardware.

## ✨ Features

-   **Single-Cycle Architecture**: All instructions complete in one clock cycle, simplifying control logic.
-   **RISC-V ISA Support**: Implements a subset of the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture, focusing on core integer instructions (R-type, I-type, Load/Store, Branch).
-   **Modular Verilog Design**: Organized Verilog modules for key CPU components, including:
    -   Program Counter (PC)
    -   Instruction Memory
    -   Register File
    -   ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
    -   Data Memory
    -   Control Unit
    -   Sign Extender
    -   Muxes and other combinational logic
-   **Xilinx Vivado Integration**: Complete project setup for Vivado, enabling seamless simulation, synthesis, and implementation.
-   **Simulation Environment**: Includes a basic testbench setup for verifying processor functionality with example programs.

## 🚀 Quick Start

To explore or modify this RISC-V processor design, you'll need the Xilinx Vivado Design Suite installed.

### Prerequisites

-   **Xilinx Vivado Design Suite:** Version 20XX.X or later (specific version depends on when the project was created, typically compatible across recent versions).
    [Download Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KrushnSurlakar/Single-Cycle-Risk-V-Processor.git
    cd Single-Cycle-Risk-V-Processor
    ```

2.  **Open the project in Vivado**
    -   Launch Xilinx Vivado Design Suite.
    -   Select `Open Project` from the start page or `File > Project > Open`.
    -   Navigate to the cloned repository directory and select the `RISC_V_PROCESSOR.xpr` file.

3.  **Explore the design**
    -   Once the project is open, you can view the source files under `Design Sources` in the `Sources` window.
    -   Examine the block diagrams, RTL schematics, and individual Verilog modules.

## 📁 Project Structure

This project follows the typical structure generated by the Xilinx Vivado Design Suite:

```
project-root/
├── RISC_V_PROCESSOR.cache/        # Vivado project cache files
├── RISC_V_PROCESSOR.hw/           # Hardware definition files, output from synthesis/implementation
├── RISC_V_PROCESSOR.ip_user_files/# User IP related files (if custom IP cores are used)
├── RISC_V_PROCESSOR.sim/          # Simulation-related files (testbenches, simulation results, waveforms)
│   └── sim_1/
│       └── behav/                 # Behavioral simulation directory

├── vivado.jou                     # Vivado journal file (logs commands executed)
├── vivado.log                     # Vivado log file (detailed log of operations)
└── <backup_vivado_files>/         # Backup journal and log files
```

## ⚙️ Usage & Development Workflow

Once the project is opened in Vivado, you can perform the following key actions:

### Running Simulation

1.  In the `Flow Navigator` on the left, expand `Simulation`.
2.  Click on `Run Behavioral Simulation`. This will compile your Verilog source files and run the defined testbench.
3.  The `Waveform` window will appear, displaying the simulation results. You can add signals of interest to visualize their behavior over time.

### Synthesis & Implementation

If you wish to synthesize the design and potentially implement it on a target FPGA:

1.  **Synthesize Design**: In the `Flow Navigator`, click `Run Synthesis`. This step translates your Verilog code into a gate-level netlist.
2.  **Implement Design**: After successful synthesis, click `Run Implementation`. This includes placement and routing for a specified target device.
3.  **Generate Bitstream**: If a target FPGA is set up (via `.xdc` constraint files in `RISC_V_PROCESSOR.srcs/constrs_1`), you can generate a bitstream file (`.bit`) that can be loaded onto an FPGA.
